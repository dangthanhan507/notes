# IsaacSim Core

Understanding isaacsim core is important because that is what TacEX uses mostly.

Adding objects using Core API is as simple as this...

```python
import numpy as np
from isaacsim.core.api.objects import DynamicCuboid

DynamicCuboid(
   prim_path="/new_cube_2",
   name="cube_1",
   position=np.array([0, 0, 1.0]),
   scale=np.array([0.6, 0.5, 0.2]),
   size=1.0,
   color=np.array([255, 0, 0]),
)
```

Actually, this is a wrapper around the physics engine APIs and raw USD APIs.

## Application vs. Simulation vs. World vs. Scene vs. Stage

Everything in USD is a primitive with attributes.

**Simulation**: moves primitives forward in time.

**Application**: manages gross aspects of simulation (rendering and interaction).

**Stage**: (from USD) defines logical and relational context for primitives in simulation.
- example: mug prim on table prim. relative location of mug on table is defined in stage.

**Scene**: manages collection of primitives in stage.

**World**: provides context to simulation and manages user-important aspects of simulation.

Analogy from isaacsim omniverse is that we are in a theater:
- application is theater
- simulation is the play
- we take a seat and see the stage.
- when play starts, curtain reveals a scene.
- when curtain falls, scene resets.
- stage crew and mechanical devices behind the scene that manages the curtain and props is the world.

# Python


## Quickly running python scripts

In the Isaac Sim codebase, there is `python.sh` file located in `source/scripts/python/linux-x86_64`. Here's a quick breakdown on how to get it running.

```bash
SCRIPT_DIR="$( cd "$( dirname "${BASH_SOURCE[0]}" )" && pwd )"
# MY_DIR="$(realpath -s "$SCRIPT_DIR")"

# Setup python env from generated file (generated by tools/repoman/build.py)
export CARB_APP_PATH=$SCRIPT_DIR/kit
export ISAAC_PATH=$SCRIPT_DIR
export EXP_PATH=$SCRIPT_DIR/apps
source ${SCRIPT_DIR}/setup_python_env.sh
```

Variables:
- `EXP_PATH`: apps folder
- `SCRIPT_DIR`: main isaac folder
- `ISAAC_PATH`: same as `SCRIPT_DIR`
- `PYTHONPATH`: path to each extensions python interfaces
- `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`: path to binary interfaces so that we can find binary symbols at runtime.
- `CARB_APP_PATH`: path to core omniverse kit executable.


```bash
python_exe=${PYTHONEXE:-"${SCRIPT_DIR}/kit/python/bin/python3"}

# this means if you ran source python.sh arg1 arg2 arg2, it'll pop up in $@....
# in other words this takes your arguments (script.py arg2 arg3 ...) and passes it to the python
$python_exe $@
```

In other words, running `./python.sh script.py arg1 arg2` will execute `python3 script.py arg1 arg2` with the python interpreter located in `kit/python/bin/python3`. Before that, it sets up all the appropriate environment variables so that the python interpreter can find all the necessary libraries.

## Simulation App

Now that we can run python scripts, we can start doing some coding.

```python
from isaacsim import SimulationApp

# Simple example showing how to start and stop the helper
simulation_app = SimulationApp({"headless": True})

### Perform any omniverse imports here after the helper loads ###

simulation_app.update()  # Render a single frame
simulation_app.close()  # Cleanup application
```

This is a really quick and easy way to get an app running.

## How SimulationApp works

```python
import carb
import omni.kit.app

# start up carbonite framework.
framework = carb.get_framework()
framework.load_plugins(
    loaded_file_wildcards=["omni.kit.app.plugin"],
    search_paths=[os.path.abspath(f'{os.environ["CARB_APP_PATH"]}/kernel/plugins')],
)

# Inject a experience config
sys.argv.insert(1, f'{os.environ["EXP_PATH"]}/isaacsim.exp.base.python.kit')

# Add paths to extensions
sys.argv.append(f"--ext-folder")
sys.argv.append(f'{os.path.abspath(os.environ["ISAAC_PATH"])}/exts')

# Run headless
sys.argv.append("--no-window")

# start application
app = omni.kit.app.get_app()
app.startup("Isaac-Sim", os.environ["CARB_APP_PATH"], sys.argv)

# shutting down application
app.shutdown()
framework.unload_all_plugins()
```

## Enabling additional extensions

```python
from isaacsim import SimulationApp

# Start the application
simulation_app = SimulationApp({"headless": False})

# Get the utility to enable extensions
from isaacsim.core.utils.extensions import enable_extension

# Enable the layers and stage windows in the UI
enable_extension("omni.kit.widget.stage")
enable_extension("omni.kit.widget.layers")

simulation_app.update()
```
