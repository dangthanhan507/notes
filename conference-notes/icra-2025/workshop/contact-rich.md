# Contact-Rich Workshop (5/19/2025)

## Parth Shah (TRI)

Training LBM with Vision Language Action Model (VLA).

Can language steer behavior? (RACER)

please decode this 5133733

They're collecting data in simulation and transferring training on that. Transferring to real-world. 

They're chasing after long-horizon tasks. They claim that their LBM is able to work pretty well. STRONG CLAIM: they claim to be close to solving dexterity. 

Not too convinced. They need to show more results (especially in-the-wild).

## Kris Hauser (UIUC)

Reasoning about "stuffs".

Rigid Object model-based world:
- highly explaniable
- precise?
- simulation

Policy Learning
- low complexity
- low explainability

<b> Claim </b>: scene graph nor pixels suffice.

<b> Desiderata </b>:
- Fully deformable 3d models
- Adaptive to observed behavior
- Integration of touch
- heterogeneous materials (not just one material per body)
- incremental and lifelong mapping?
- cross-modal correlation
