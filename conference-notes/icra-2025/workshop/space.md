# Space Workshop (5/19/2025)

## Nima Fazeli

<b> Context: </b> Crows is more of a materials crowd. They're much more inclined towards model-based approach to space manipulation.

Nima presenting the usual stuff. Tries to convince a crowd to adopt tactile technology. I think the marketing is to add-on tactile into the system.

For a space crowd, they may be concerned about the compute requirements of the work he's presenting (Miquel's work). This is especially the case when the spacecraft is naturally resource-constrained. 

Another thing is that on a spacecraft, we're using a floating-base. Can we keep the current assumptions from tabletop manipulation (quasi-static, )?
