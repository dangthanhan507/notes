# Optimization and Control Keynote

## Ram Vasudevan 

In contrast to Vision-Language-Action (VLA) model. Requires a lot of data to train.
- Physics intuition

If you're an optimization person, you should try to pivot. 

Current ways of using models may not be that useful. Using it as a "shield". Things like peripherlas for the end2end model.

Open Problems to beyond the demo:
- Quantifying error (conformal prediction)
- Fuse Physics + Perception into Learning
- Explain VLA generalization

## Yana

Signal Temporal Logic for robust control and safety-based control.

I think it's too abstract and it doesn't necessarily break down how STL creates an optimization program. Logic is like a 0/1 boolean. 

How is that relaxed and what does that translate to for optimization?
