# Hand Discussion

## 1. Why do we want dexterous hands?

Questions:
1. What are core capabilities we are missing?
2. What are some tasks we cannot achieve with parallel jaw?
3. Can capabilities be achieved with bimanual?

### 1.1 

Currently with a single-arm jaw gripper setup, we are limited to a humble amount of tasks.
- Lots of things are just being done with BC or RL.

What can't a jaw do?
- only one way to grasp... is that bad?
    - can't roll 

What's the utility of more ways to grasp?

### 1.3 

With bimanual, it's just unconstrained parallel jaw.
- It's pretty tough to do anything past parallel jaw capabilities.
    - You could say extra fingers are to make grasped object more stable.

What about deformable manipulation?

<b> NOTE: </b> ML argument is that we want to learn from data, and to mimic human form factor.

bimanual benefits:
- transfer grasps.

Difference between hand and jaw:
- super high dimensional
    - lots of behavior that can be generated with multi-finger setup (idk about current sota).




## 2. Integration with existing major directions?

1. VLAs?
2. Large scale RL with sim2real?
3. Model-based stuff?
