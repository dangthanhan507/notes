# August 27


# 1. Get into Lagrangian and minimal coordinates.

## Newton's laws
1. Every object in a state of uniform motion will remain in that state of motion unless acted upon by a net external force.
2. The acceleration of an object is directly proportional to the net force acting on the object and inversely proportional to the object's mass.
3. For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction.

Look at Principia Chandrasekar


Lagrange Equations
- Generalized coordinates 
- minimal set of variables needed to describe configuration of system

Double pendulum example:
- we can describe with $$(x^1, y^1, x^2, y^2)$$
- we can also use angles $$(\theta^1, \theta^2)$$
- angle representation is the minimal representation

Question: systematic way to determine a minimal set of coordinates?

# 2. Lagrangian and Hamiltonian
- related Principle of Least Action
- Maupertuis (google: known for principle of least action)
    - theory for motion of particles
    - analogous to Fermat's principle of least time
Best example to think about is light (snell's law).

formalized by Euler
Later Hamilton's principle 1834 - 1835

Notes about snell's law:
- slower in water $$n_1 > n_2$$
- where V is velocity $$n_1 = \frac{1}{V_c}$$
- equation: $$n_1 \sin \theta_1 = n_2 \sin \theta_2$$

how do we know this minimizes time? how to verify?

- maximize time in easier medium
- minimize time spent in tougher medium
- this now minimizes total time spent from point A to point B

$$
\begin{align*}
T = \text{total time} \\
c_1 = \frac{1}{n_1} \\
a = \text{height of easy medium} \\
b = \text{height of tough medium} \\
\ell = \text{total horizontal length} \\
x = \text{horizontal length of easy medium} \\
T = \frac{\sqrt{a^2 + x^2}}{c_1} + \frac{\sqrt{b^2 + (\ell - x)^2}}{c_2}
\end{align*}
$$

We can minimize $$T$$ by taking critical points (calculus).

Can't prove physics laws. One way to come up with them is to use foundational principles.

## 2 principles for particles
- least action
- hamilton's principle

## Lagrangian
- derived by force-balance
- Newton's laws in generalized coordinates
- Lagrangian smooth function $$\mathcal{L}(q^1, ..., q^i, t)$$

## Hamiltonian 
- derived by variational principle
- config space
- variational princple: $$\mathcal{L} = T - V$$
- $$\delta \int_0^T \mathcal{L}(q^i, \dot{q}^i, t) dt = 0$$ over all curves $$q^i(t)$$

Let $$\delta q^i$$ be variation of the curve.

$$
\begin{align}
\int_a^b (\frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial q^i} \delta q^i + \frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial \dot{q}^i} \delta \dot{q}^i) dt \quad \forall \delta q^i \\
\delta \dot{q}^i = \frac{d}{dt} \delta q^i \\
\delta q^i = 0 \quad \text{at} \quad t = a \quad t=b \\
\int_a^b (\frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial q^i} - \frac{d}{dt}(\frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial \dot{q}^i})) \partial q^i dt \quad \forall \delta q^i \\
\end{align} 
$$

integral of 0 is 0, so just solve the term within the integral. this is nice because we don't care about the value of $$\partial q^i$$

$$
\begin{equation}
\frac{d}{dt} \frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial \dot{q}^i} - \frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial q^i} = 0
\end{equation}
$$

Now we can get 

$$
\begin{align*}
\mathcal{L} &= \frac{1}{2} \sum_{i=1}^n m_i \|\dot{q}_i\|^2 - V(q,i) \\
&=> \frac{d}{dt} (m,q) - \frac{\partial V}{\partial q^i} = 0
\end{align*}
$$

if we take $$\frac{d}{dt}$$ operator on lagrangian above we get that nice equation below...

$$ L = T - V $$

where T is kinetic and V is potential.

So one way of thinking about lagrangian EoM is a way of minimizing $$T-V$$ (difference between potential and kinetic energy).

Say you're a particle on a sphere shell. You want to go from point A to point B. There are two arcs if your lagrangian is only kinetic energy. The lagrangian can represent multiple paths while the lower-level dynamics might only suggest one.

## Hamilton's Equations

$$
\begin{align}
\frac{d}{dt} \frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial \dot{q}^i} - \frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial q^i} &= 0 \\
p_i &= \frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial \dot{q}^i} \\
H &= \sum_{i=1}^n \dot{q}^i p_i - \mathcal{L} \\
\frac{\partial H}{\partial p_i} &= \dot{q}^i \\
\frac{\partial H}{\partial q^i} &= -\frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial q^i} - \frac{d}{dt} (\frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial \dot{q}^i}) \\
&= \frac{d}{dt} p_i 
\end{align}
$$


In total

$$
\begin{align}
\frac{d}{dt} p_i &= -\frac{\partial H}{\partial q^i} \\
\frac{d}{dt} q^i &= \frac{\partial H}{\partial p_i}
\end{align}
$$

If $$\mathcal{L} = T - V$$ then $$H = T + V$$. 
- generalize to manifold
- symplectic, poisson manifolds

Why do hamiltonian?
- Promise that it works better on geometry (preserves volume)
- Lagrangian is better when there is dissipation

Next time:
- Flows on a manifold (flow from dynamical systems)
- Existence and Uniqueness of ODE

$$
\begin{align*}
\dot x = x \\
\dot x = \sqrt{x} \\
\dot x = x^2
\end{align*}
$$
