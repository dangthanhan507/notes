# Calculus of Variations - Serious

I yoinked these notes from Brian Keng wh ofollows Svetitsky's Notes on Functionals. This is more true to the actual calculus of variations math.

Zack Manchester's notes were very layman and described the methodology of using calculus of variations in ways we could understand. I now want to understand the deeper math and terminology.
